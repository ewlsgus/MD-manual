# MD Manual

This manual was written to be used by the members of the Klotsa Group at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The contents of this manual will provide you with a guide to get started with molecular dynamics simulations using [HOOMD-blue](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/) and post-processing the generated data using various tools such as [Python](https://www.python.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [freud](https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/), and more.

To get started with setting up your machine with an environment to run the simulations, go to [Development Environment Setup](dev_env_setup/dev_env_setup_main.md) page.

To get started with running HOOMD-blue MD simulations, go to [HOOMD-blue Tutorial](hoomd_tutorial/hoomd_tutorial_main.md) page.

To get started with processing/visualizing your simulation data, go to [Post-processing Tutorial](post_proc/post_proc_main.md) page.
