# Setting up Windows machine with VS Code

On Windows machines, I recommend using VS Code as it provides a platform that works out of the box with WSL. To use VS Code with WSL, start by downloading VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/Download>.

Once you've downloaded and installed VS Code, type `code` in your working directory to open up VS Code in that directory. For your first run or when there are updates, WSL will automatically install the required software for connetion and it will open up VS Code in the directory.
