# What is HOOMD-blue
From the documentation,
>HOOMD-blue is a Python package that runs simulations of particle systems on CPUs and GPUs. It performs hard particle Monte Carlo simulations of a variety of shape classes and molecular dynamics simulations of particles with a range of pair, bond, angle, and other potentials. Many features are targeted at the soft matter research community, though the code is general and capable of many types of particle simulations.
